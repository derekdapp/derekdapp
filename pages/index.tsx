            A labor of love (literally). Everlly is a product that I have spent
            the last few years working on as a solo endeavour. From scheduling
            to messaging to cleaning reminders, Everlly can do it all. The idea
            behind Everlly is that before, during and after a wedding ring sale,
            the client and business should stay connected. Many shops offer a
            lifetime warranty on their rings on condition that the client
            returns yearly to have their ring inspected and cleaned. Everlly is
            the tool that allows clients to keep track of when they should get
            their ring cleaned and it allows businesses to have further contact
            with their client after their initial sale.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Everlly has come very far, but still has some ways to go before an
            MVP is ready for businesses to start beta testing. It will take a
            few more late nights and weekends to finish, but I&apos;m excited to
            see it come to life and to share the progress so far. Use the link
            below to learn more about the technologies I used in Everlly and to
            see what features it has.

              I have also worked on some other great projects not listed here.
              These include a custom Learning Management System, an app to help
              people learn to read Chinese, and a mobile app to see how your car
              would look with different styles of rims. I also worked on a
              product geared towards personalized sales presentations.

              I should also note that the projects in my portfolio do not
              include those that I did for school, that list would be too long
              to include here. However, those were also great projects that I
              learned a lot from.

              One of my first apps I built was a game called &quot;Cat Or
              Dog&quot; that went surprisingly viral on Reddit. My follow-up to
              that was a web app called &quot;Is It A Bangr?&quot; loosely
              referencing the TV show Parks and Recreation that earned me
              another 15 minutes of fame on{" "}

              Sadly, these projects aren&apos;t live anymore, but they were some
              of the key early projects that helped to jumpstart my career.
